A long time ago in a galaxy far far away,
There was a young boy, by the name of Dumble, with tremendous power.
That power was caled. . ."deez". With this supernatural gift,
he was able to annihalate and adversary that came before him.
There were various incantation skills that he picked up along the way,
"sea deez", "wen deez", and many more. He abused this power in order to gain
money and influence in his local star group. But finally, an enemy capable of rivaling
his power appeared. His name was . . . Ligma.
